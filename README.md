# GmailSpreadsheets
Google Spreadsheet macros to get insights about your mail.
### How to use
* Open a new blank Google Spreadsheet document ([link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/)).
* Go to **Tools > Command sequence editor**
* In the newly opened editor tab paste the contents of the [code.gs](code.gs) file.
* **Save** the project and go back to the Spreadheet tab.
* Go to **Tools > Macros > Import** and add the functions "**custom_list**", "**promotions_list**", "**social_list**" and "**updates_list**". Don't add the "list" function since it shouldn't be directly called by the user.
* Accept the notification asking for authorization.
* You are good to go! All you have to do is go again to **Tools > Macros** and select the function you want to execute. You can also add, delete and assign keyboard shortcuts to the functions from the **Manage** option in the Macros menu.

### Recommendations
You can sort the mail recipients by clicking on the little arrow on the **B** column header and select the **Sort Z -> A** option.

Thanks!
